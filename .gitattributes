# Define text file attributes.
# - Treat them as text.
# - Ensure no CRLF line-endings, neither on checkout nor on checkin.
# - Detect whitespace errors.
#   - Exposed by default in `git diff --color` on the CLI.
#   - Validate with `git diff --check`.
#   - Deny applying with `git apply --whitespace=error-all`.
#   - Fix automatically with `git apply --whitespace=fix`.

# Handle line endings automatically for files detected as text
# and leave all files detected as binary untouched.
* text=auto

# Force the following filetypes to have unix eols, so Windows does not break them
*.* text eol=lf

# These files are binary and should be left untouched
